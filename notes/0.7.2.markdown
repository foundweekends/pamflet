### page.localPath

The property `page.localPath` is automatically injected when rendering the layout markdown, which allows, for instance, the construction of a direct-to-GitHub page edit URL in the header or footer, e.g:

    <a href="https://github.com/foundweekends/pamflet/edit/master/src/test/pf/$page.localPath$">[edit]</a>
