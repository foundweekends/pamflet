This release adds several features, all of which can be seen in
[Pamflet's own documentation][pf]:

* [Contents in Depth][depth] — A table of contents that includes
  headers from within pages
* [Combined Pages][combined] — A single webpage containing the full
  pamflet contents, with internal links to each "page"
* Print-friendly stylesheets — Navigation elements are removed. This
  works best with the combined pages feature.
* [Fork me on GitHub][fork] — If a "github" link is present in the template
  properties file, a GitHub ribbon is added to the top of each page.
