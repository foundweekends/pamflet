Custom Stylesheets
------------------

To give your project that special edge, you will surely want to set
all headings to Copperplate MT or Bank Gothic.

Not to worry, Pamflet supports this. All files in the source directory
with the extension `css` will be packaged with the pamflet. These will
be loaded after all other stylesheets, so go crazy.
