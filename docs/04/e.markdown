If you want your pamflet to carry your favorite pic or any other goodie add it 
to a `files` directory just below `docs` and link to it as if this directory 
were beside your pamflet page.

So, supposing you drop a file named `a.txt` into `docs/files/` then 
`[some file](files/a.txt)` becomes [some file](files/a.txt) and works!

### Embedding images 

Of course, the trick works great for images too, using usual markdown:
 
```
![some svg](files/an.svg)
```

Becomes

![some svg](files/an.svg)

Nice, isn't it?
