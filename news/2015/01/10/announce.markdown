Pamflet to Publish News
-----------------------

I made Pamflet to publish writing that can be comfortably read from beginning to end, with a logically organized table of contents. It imitates useful patterns of print without the complexity of trying to efficiently and attractively fill discreet sheets of paper.

Pamflet became a useful technical publishing tool to a [few people][3], and I've lately been interested in applying its principles to another kind of publishing: **News**.

A brief and personal history of news
------------------------------------

Publishing news on the internet is perhaps the most popular problem that we recreational programmers choose to solve. The old-timers started with static site generators, and following that the field was dominated by customized web applications serving (or [trying to serve][4]) dynamic content. But when everybody moved to hybrid platforms that combine social networking and publishing, recreational programmers fell off the bus.

I've spent my share of time writing for the second and third incarnations of internet publishing, the personal web app and the social network. First I wrote and used my own blogging software, and even *maintained* it for a few years. Later I switched to Tumblr, to benefit from The Network. But I never really fit in there. I waited years for esoteric markdown bugs to be fixed. I lost significant work from normal network issues. I lamented the total absence of version control in the workflow.

And as much as social networks are supposed to bring human contact into the solitary activity of computing, for me Tumblr had the opposite effect. My writing was less seen, less reacted to, less meaningful than it was before. With my feedback loop broken, I stopped writing entirely.

It's not Tumblr's fault that it didn't work for me; it apparently fills a need for hundreds of millions of people/spammers. But for me, the constraints it placed on my work were in no way repaid by exposure.

The good stuff
--------------

Pamflet *is* a static site generator. (The old-timers were right.) It was built to imitate the good stuff of print publishing, in small but useful ways. 

To repeat the exercise, I asked myself what worked for me in blogging. A big part of it was that I built up a small but reliable daily readership through the regular posting of short posts, typically a link with some brief comment on its contents. By limiting myself to a sentence or two, I could post fairly quickly with a recognizable voice. (Something I've never mastered in Twitter's even more anemic format.)

It was fun at the time, but those readers are long gone and it's safe to say that finding them again would be very difficult indeed. As early internet users we maintained a list of sites to check, to occupy our spare time. Now, we check Facebook, Twitter, and one or two pro media properties. Web bookmarks and the assorted front pages they reference have become internet graveyards.

But the other way that I had some luck in blogging continues to function. It's pretty simple: write something that resonates. Do it well and your work will be shared by online friends. And occasionally -- you won't know when, and it probably won't be your best work -- your writing will be re-broadcast by Reddit or Hacker News. Perhaps, even, by some drive-by Thought Leader. It's kind of cool.

Applying the beliefs
--------------------

Since I've decided to believe that amassing a regular readership is impossible or not worth the effort, I don't need to spend time making a compelling front page. I don't need to try to keep interesting stories "above the fold", and I don't have to feel bad if I don't post anything for a month or two.

The priorities then are that the content itself should be easy to read on all popular devices, easily indexed by search engines, and easily browsable if people want to read more. All that is trivial to build once you stop worrying about a splashy front page.

Then it's just a matter of writing, publishing, and sharing. Since it makes no difference to Twitter or Google where I'm published, I'll post wherever I feel like posting. This post is very recursively posted in the [Pamflet][2] project. Thought Leaders, take note!
